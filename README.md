# Wooden_Planets
these are the files i used to creat the Wooden Planets project. please feel free to use, modify or improve them for your own use.
if you want to learn more about Wooden Planets, please visit www.XXXXX.ch

the solar_system(_live) files compute the vallues i need, and the ss_simulation(_live) run the simulation virtually.
the motor_ files control the motors of the physical build and need the solar_system files to run properly.
