# Wooden_Planets
These are the files I used to creat the Wooden Planets project. Please feel free to use, modify or improve them. All critics and recomendations are welcome.
If you want to learn more about the Wooden Planets project, please visit www.AAAAAA.ch

The solar_system and solar_system_live files compute planetary positions using orbital elements, as explained by Paul Schlyter (https://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html) solar_system computes only once on the given date, and solar_system_live modifies the date and recomputes as specified inside the code.

The ss_simulation and ss_simulatuon_live files use these data to creat simulations of the solar system.

The motor_ files control the motors of the pysical model I built. (more informations on www.AAAAAA.ch)
